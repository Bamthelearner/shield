Welcome to Shield, a community-driven auditing service for Cadence smart contracts and transactions.

## Motiviation

Permissionless deployment launched on June 5th, 2022, which means people can deploy their own smart contracts to Mainnet. This means the world of Flow is open to very malicious scams and bad actors who will try to steal your assets.

## Goal

The goal of Shield is to better protect the community from scams. We will be reviewing smart contracts & transactions in an effort to provide all of you with a safer environment on Flow.

## Get Involved

If you're looking to help out, you can always be on the lookout in the ✅┃shield channel inside the <a href="https://discord.gg/emeraldcity">Emerald City Discord</a>. We will all work together to review code there and make sure to keep each other safe. 

This is also a fantastic opportunity to better your Cadence skills.

## How can I protect myself from scams?

1. Ask the community in the ✅┃shield channel inside the <a href="https://discord.gg/emeraldcity">Emerald City Discord</a> about contracts or transactions you don't trust.

2. Learn Cadence by joining our Beginner Cadence Bootcamps. They will really help you stay safe from scams because you will better understand the code. To join, visit our <a href="https://academy.ecdao.org/">Emerald Academy</a> site to learn more.

## Important Note

### Context

On the Flow blockchain, smart contracts can be upgraded at any point in time. This means a smart contract owner could wake up one morning and change their contract to be malicious.

### Our Answer

Because of that, Shield only officially verifies projects who are trusted by the community as being good actors. That way, not only have we verified their contract code, but we have verified the humans behind the project too.

### Disclaimer

With that being said, there is always the possibility of malicious intent and we can't catch it, due to smart contract upgradeability. With that in mind, please continue to be careful and do not put your entire trust solely into Shield.

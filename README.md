## Motiviation

Permissionless deployment launched on June 5th, 2022, which means people can deploy their own smart contracts to Mainnet. This means the world of Flow is open to very malicious scams and bad actors who will try to steal your assets.

## Goal

The goal of Shield is to better protect the community from scams. We will be reviewing smart contracts & transactions in an effort to provide all of you with a safer environment on Flow.

## Get Involved

If you're looking to help out, you can always be on the lookout in the ✅┃shield channel inside the <a href="https://discord.gg/emeraldcity">Emerald City Discord</a>. We will all work together to review code there and make sure to keep each other safe. 

This is also a fantastic opportunity to better your Cadence skills.
